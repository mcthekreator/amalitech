# Core description (Colors / Farben)

For a list of all possible Akeneo Color Keys (status as of september 2022) see: https://igusdev.atlassian.net/l/cp/VG1xkpfH. The keys all start with `Nu_Coulour_` and specify information about cores and shields.  
You will find the following approved values:

- the description texts that should be displayed (for de_DE and en_US as used by icalc)
- the css color to be used with the key (if it specifies a core)
