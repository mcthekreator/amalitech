# AXQueries

For the current csv files contained in /csv-files the queries contained in this folder (/AXQueries) have been used with only an adjustment to the names of the tables, since the current extract has been gathered directly from AX (by Ludmilla) not through the IWH.
For more information on the current retrieval of data from AX see: https://igusdev.atlassian.net/l/cp/A0XBTSLs.

These SQL queries were previously used to request the first MAT017 data (for "manual" import via flyway scripts) from the AX Team.

For the ones used for the original import there are also matching views that were created in the IWH Data Hub production environment.

The ones used for V16 were executed manually by the icalc Team in the IWH environment (https://igusdev.atlassian.net/l/cp/yAv3w7mC).
